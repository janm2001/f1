                      <p>he British Grand Prix was an eventful affair, with the race dominated by a number of tyre failures throughout the field. Daniil Kvyat, Carlos Sainz and Valtteri Bottas all suffered punctures, as the Pirelli rubber struggled to cope with the intense forces that are part and parcel of the Silverstone circuit.</p>

            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p>Formula One is a global leviathan. In 2017, its global audience was 352.3 million people. The sponsorship income of the manufacturers is in the hundreds of millions of Euros per year. The top speed of the Formula One car is 231 miles per hour. Put simply, everything in Formula One is done to a huge scale. One of Formula One’s greatest strengths is the fact that – despite all of the engineering expertise and technology – it is a simple sport.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-12">
            <p>There is something inherently visceral about watching incredibly skilled drivers hurtle hugely quick cars around a race track. Despite the ever-growing speed, Formula One is a safer sport now than ever in its history. Indeed, throughout its nearly 80 year past, Formula One has, every year, become both faster and safer. This is the real engineering skill of the sport.</p>

            <h4>EARLY GRANDS PRIX</h4>
            <p>Ever since there have been cars, there has been car racing. As technology improved, and cars became more numerous, European manufacturers began racing as a way of competing and marketing their products.</p>
            <p>In the interwar years, a series of Grands Prix took place throughout Europe, designed to show off car and driver skills to a receptive European population.</p>

            <h4>PRE-WWII</h4>
            <p>Had World War II not intervened it is likely that Formula One would have begun much earlier. Certainly, in the interwar years, there was an increasing move towards codifying the sport from the ragtag one-off events.</p>
            <p>With the rise of Nazism, and the focus of French and Belgian (and other European) engineers onto preparation for war, however, Formula One was put on hold until 1946.</p>

            <h4>DEVELOPMENT OF FORMULA ONE</h4>
            <p>The name ‘Formula One’ refers to a standardized set of rules with which drivers and engineers must comply. In 1946, the idea of a Formula One Championship began. From 1946-1950 the races were not part of an overall calendar and races tended to be ad hoc affairs.</p>
